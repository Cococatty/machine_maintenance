You can use pip3 using the alias pip by adding alias to your .bashrc file.

alias pip=pip3
or by adding a symlink named pip to your $PATH, which points to the pip3 binary.

If there is no ~/.bashrc in your home directory on macOS, inputting

alias pip=pip3
in your ~/.zprofile file has the same effect.
